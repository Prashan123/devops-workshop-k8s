Explanation of kubernetes_devops.txt Command Sequence
These lines are a sequence of shell commands, mostly using kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool. They appear to be a step-by-step history or tutorial of basic Kubernetes operations. Hereâ€™s what they collectively aim to achieve:

Basic Cluster Exploration:

kubectl get nodes: List all nodes in the cluster.
kubectl get pods, kubectl get ns: List pods and namespaces.
Pod Lifecycle Management:

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx: Create a pod running the nginx container.
kubectl get pods: Check the status of pods.
kubectl delete pods/nginx: Delete the nginx pod.
Namespace Management:

kubectl create namespace hi / kubectl delete ns hi: Create and delete a namespace named hi.
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>: List pods in a specific namespace.
YAML File Usage:

vi pod.yml, dep.yml, ns.yml: Edit YAML files for pod, deployment, and namespace configuration.
kubectl apply -f <file>: Apply these configurations to the cluster.
Deployment Management:

kubectl get deployments, kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=5: Manage deployments and scale the number of pods.
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.29.0: Update the deployment to use a specific nginx image version.
Pod Interaction:

kubectl exec -it nginx -n nginx -- bash: Open a shell inside the nginx pod in the nginx namespace.
General Shell Commands:

clear, ls, mkdir, cd, touch, vi: Basic Linux shell commands for navigation, file creation, and editing.
Summary:
This block documents a learning or workshop session where someone is practicing core Kubernetes operations: working with pods, namespaces, and deployments, applying YAML configurations, scaling and updating workloads, and using basic shell commands to support those activities.
